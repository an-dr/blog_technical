Before moving to the reimplementing of moving platform on ESP32 I've added some documentation to the [zakharos_core repository](https://github.com/an-dr/zakharos_core). Code has a lot of roughness that will be polished later (probably on the next milestone - [The Emotions Demo](https://github.com/an-dr/zakhar#milestones))

Documentation is not complete but will be supplemented with time. Probably the illustration, requirements and how to build should be enough to check the implementation out. So PTAL if you are interested!
