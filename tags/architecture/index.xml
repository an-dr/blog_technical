But I want to make several special decisions to make the project easy to transfer to my another robotic project</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id="what-is-the-project-about">What is the project about?</h1><p>It is a cat companion. A simple robot that can move around, avoid big obstacles and move a stick for playing with a cat.</p><h1 id="what-is-the-first-step">What is the first step?</h1><p>Iâ€™m starting with the architecture development. I will try to make the most abstract decisions first, leaving the implementation details to the very end.</p><p>The first step is development of the use cases. Basically, there are 3 actors for this robot - a cat, a cat owner, and me, a robotic developer. As a developer, It is important for me to have a moving platform (legs, wheels, etc.) reusable by other projects, so it is also reflected in my use case diagram:</p><p><img class="img-zoomable" src="usecase.drawio.svg" alt="usecase"/></p><p>That is it for now. Next time we will probably define the system requirements based on each use case.</p></description></item></channel></rss>
